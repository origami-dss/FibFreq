Description: Irregular oscillations are a typical feature of time series. Examples include ECGs of fibrillating heart, 
  EEGs of meditating monks, the dynamics of population sizes and the sunspot numbers. 
  The 'FibFreq' package provides seven functions for estimating the fundamental frequency of univariate time series including quantities measuring the uncertainty of these 
  estimates and of the regularity of the oscillation. 
  This package was originally developed for the analysis of electrocardiograms (ECGs) from fibrillating murine hearts, a data set with 112 of such ECGs is included. 
  The package is closely associated with the manuscript "Unraveling Cardiac Arrhythmia Frequency, Comparative Analysis Using Time and Frequency Domain Algorithms"
  by Laura Diaz-Maue, Annette Witt, and Holger Nobach, submitted to 'Frontiers in Signal Processing'.
